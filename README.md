# GitHub Actions with tox and pytest

The repository demonstrates the use of **GitHub Actions** with **tox** and **pytest** and 
is separated from the other (repository)[https://github.com/ax-va/Pytest-Okken-2022]
dedicated to pytest. See also the `11--tox/11-6--running-tox-with-github-actions.md` example there.

## Settings

See a workflow `.yml` file in `.github/workflows/` at the top level of the project.
The GitHub Actions tab should look like this â€” tests are run on every push or pull request.
